## Introduction
### - Project Overview
### - Goals and Objectives


## Software Architectural Design (as appropriate)
### - Required External Libraries
This project uses Qt, Glew 1.10 and glm and openGL libraries as well as the standard library. The glew library is already included in the source code repository.
### - Functional Block Diagrams
### - Data Flow Diagrams
### - UML Diagrams showing Object Definition/Inheritance
The objective of this project is model accurate jellyfish behavior for various uses in robotics, gaming and animation. The project is user interactive in which user can choose different modes of behavior.
## Build Instructions

## Usage Documentation
The code can be run on qt creator or could be compiled with the CMake file.

## Interface Descriptions (as appropriate)
### - Graphical Interface
The graphical interface consists of a main window that contains the jellyfish scene. The camera in the scene can be zoomed in and out by middle mouse button wheel. Any mouse button pressed and moved will rotate the scene so the jellyfish can be seen from all angles.
### - Data Visualization
The data consists of the object (.obj) file that was created in blender. The team has written a parser to understand 
### - Communications Protocols
### - Threading and Concurrency
### - Exception Handling

## Testing and Evaluation

### - Operating system(s) and software compiler/library version(s) tested
### - Description of functional testing to date
### - Instructions for compiling and running the software

## Conclusions
